This is just a place to store my attempts of the [Advent of Code] programming puzzles as I
work through them.

Puzzles can be run using `npm start`:

    npm start -- year21/day01/part2.ts

Puzzle text and input files have been omitted from this repository to respect the [redistribution wishes] of the
project, but can be found on the Advent of Code website.
