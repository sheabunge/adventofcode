This is just a place to store my attempts of the [Advent of Code] programming puzzles as I work through them.

Puzzles can be tested using `npm start`:

```shell
npm start -- year24/day01/part2.ts
```

Puzzle text and input files have been omitted from this repository to respect the [redistribution wishes] of the
project, but can be found on the [Advent of Code] website.

Before testing, copy the example input from the puzzle text to a file called `example.txt` in the same directory as the
puzzle code, and download the provided `input.txt` file to the same directory.
